<h3>GRETA</h3>

<p><i>January 18, Earth Time</i></p>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">I&nbsp;wish</span> Max would treat me
like a <i>woman</i>.</p>

<p>An hour ago, at dinner,
John Armitage proposed a toast,
especially for my benefit. He
loves to play the gallant. Big man,
silver mane, very blue eyes, a
porcelain smile. The head of
WSC, the perfect example of the
politician-scientist.</p>

<p>"To the colony," he announced,
raising his glass. "May Epsilon
love them and keep them.
May it only be transmittal trouble."</p>

<p>"Amen," Max said.</p>

<p>We drank. Taylor Bishop put
down his glass precisely. Bishop
is a gray little man with a diffident
voice that belies his reputation
as the best biochemist in
the system. "Has Farragut hinted
otherwise?" he asked mildly.</p>

<p>Armitage frowned. "It would
be scarcely prudent for Senator
Farragut to alarm the populace
with disaster rumors."</p>

<p>Bishop looked at him out of
his pale eyes. "Besides, it's an
election year."</p>

<p>The silence was suddenly ugly.</p>

<p>Then Armitage chuckled. "All
right," he said. "So the Senator
wants to be a national hero. The
fact still remains that Epsilon
had better be habitable or Pan-Asia
will scream we're hogging
it. They want war anyway. Within
a month&mdash;boom."</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">For</span> a moment, I was afraid
he was going to make a speech
about Earth's suffocating billions,
the screaming tension of
the cold war, and the sacred necessity
of Our Mission. If he had,
I'd have gotten the weeping
shrieks. Some responsibilities are
too great to think about. But instead
he winked at me. For the
first time, I began to realize why
Armitage was the Director of the
Scientists' World Council.</p>

<p>"Hypothesis, Greta," he said.
"Epsilon is probably a paradise.
Why should the test colony let
the rest of the world in on it?
They're being selfish."</p>

<p>I giggled. We relaxed.</p>

<p>After supper, Armitage played
chess with Bishop while I followed
Max into the control room.</p>

<p>"Soon?" I said.</p>

<p>"Planetfall in eighteen hours,
Doctor." He said it stiffly, busying
himself at the controls. Max
is a small dark man with angry
eyes and the saddest mouth I've
ever seen. He is also a fine pilot
and magnificent bacteriologist. I
wanted to slap him. I hate these
professional British types that
think a female biochemist is some
sort of freak.</p>

<p>"Honestly," I said. "What do
you think?"</p>

<p>"Disease," he said bitterly.
"For the first six months they
reported on schedule, remember?
A fine clean planet, no dominant
life-forms, perfect for immigration;
unique, one world in a billion.
Abruptly they stopped sending.
You figure it."</p>

<p>I thought about it.</p>

<p>"I read your thematic on Venusian
viruses," he said abruptly.
"Good show. You should be an
asset to us, Doctor."</p>

<p>"Thanks!" I snapped. I was
so furious that I inadvertently
looked into the cabin viewplate.</p>

<p>Bishop had warned me. It takes
years of deep-space time to enable
a person to stare at the
naked Universe without screaming.</p>

<p>It got me. The crystal thunder
of the stars, that horrible hungry
blackness. I remember I was sort
of crying and fighting, then Max
had me by the shoulders, holding
me gently. He was murmuring
and stroking my hair. After a
time, I stopped whimpering.</p>

<div class="figr"><img src="images/001.png" width="376" height="550" alt="" title="" />
<b><small>Illustrated by STONE</small></b></div>

<p>"Thanks," I whispered.</p>

<p>"You'd better get some sleep,
Greta," he said.</p>

<p>I turned in.</p>

<p>I think I'm falling in love.</p>

<hr />

<p><i>January 19</i></p>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Today</span> we made planetfall.
It took Max a few hours to
home in on the test colony ship.
He finally found it, on the shore
of an inland sea that gleamed like
wrinkled blue satin. For a time
we cruised in widening spirals,
trying to detect some signs of
life. There was nothing.</p>

<p>We finally landed. Max and
Armitage donned spacesuits and
went toward the colony ship.
They came back in a few hours,
very pale.</p>

<p>"They're dead." Armitage's
voice cracked as he came out of
the airlock. "All of them."</p>

<p>"Skeletons," Max said.</p>

<p>"How?" Bishop said.</p>

<p>Armitage's hands were shaking
as he poured a drink. "Looks like
civil war."</p>

<p>"But there were a hundred of
them," I whispered. "They were
<i>dedicated</i>&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I wonder," Bishop said
thoughtfully. "White and brown
and yellow. Russian and British
and French and German and
Chinese and Spanish. They were
chosen for technical background
rather than emotional stability."</p>

<p>"Rot!" Armitage said like
drums beating. "It's some alien
bug, some toxin. We've got to
isolate it, find an antibody."</p>

<p>He went to work.</p>

<hr />

<p><i>January 22</i></p>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">I'm</span> scared.</p>

<p>It's taken three days to finalize
the atmospheric tests. Oxygen,
nitrogen, helium, with trace
gases. Those trace gases are
stinkers. Bishop discovered a new
inert gas, heavier than Xenon.
He's excited. I'm currently checking
stuff that looks like residual
organic, and am not too happy
about it. Still, this atmosphere
seems pure.</p>

<p>Armitage is chafing.</p>

<p>"It's in the flora," he insisted
today. "Something, perhaps, that
they ate." He stood with a strained
tautness, staring feverishly at
the chronometer. "Senator Farragut's
due to make contact soon.
What'll I tell him?"</p>

<p>"That we're working on it,"
Bishop said dryly. "That the
four best scientists in the Galaxy
are working toward the solution."</p>

<p>"That's good," Armitage said
seriously. "But they'll worry.
You <i>are</i> making progress?"</p>

<p>I wanted to wrap a pestle
around his neck.</p>

<p>We were all in the control
room an hour later. Armitage
practically stood at attention
while Farragut's voice boomed
from the transmitter.</p>

<p>It was very emetic. The Senator
said the entire hemisphere
was waiting for us to announce
the planet was safe for immigration.
He said the stars were a
challenge to Man. He spoke fearfully
of the Coming World Crisis.
Epsilon was Man's last chance
for survival. Armitage assured
him our progress was satisfactory,
that within a few days we
would have something tangible
to report. The Senator said we
were heroes.</p>

<p>Finally it was over. Max yawned.
"Wonder how many voters
start field work at once."</p>

<p>Armitage frowned. "It's not
funny, Cizon. Not funny at all.
Inasmuch as we've checked out
the atmosphere, I suggest we
start field work at once."</p>

<p>Taylor blinked. "We're still
testing a few residual&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I happen to be nominal leader
of this party." Armitage stood
very tall, very determined. "Obviously
the atmosphere is pure.
Let's make some progress!"</p>

<hr />

<p><i>February 2</i></p>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">This</span> is progress?</p>

<p>For the past ten days, we've
worked the clock around. Quantitative
analysis, soil, water,
flora, fauna, cellular, microscopic.
Nothing. Max has discovered a
few lethal alkaloids in some
greenish tree fungus, but I doubt
if the colony were indiscriminate
fungus eaters. Bishop has found
a few new unicellular types, but
nothing dangerous. There's one
tentacled thing that reminds me
of a frightened rotifer. Max
named it <i>Armitagium</i>. Armitage
is pleased.</p>

<p>Perhaps the fate of the hundred
colonists will remain one of
those forever unsolved mysteries,
like the fate of the <i>Mary Celeste</i>
or the starship <i>Prometheus</i>.</p>

<p>This planet's <i>clean</i>.</p>

<hr />

<p><i>February 4</i></p>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Today</span> Max and I went specimen-hunting.</p>

<p>It must be autumn on Epsilon.
Everywhere the trees are a riot
of scarlet and ocher, the scrubby
bushes are shedding their leaves.
Once we came upon a field of
thistlelike plants with spiny seed-pods
that opened as we watched,
the purple spores drifting afield
in an eddy of tinted mist. Max
said it reminded him of Scotland.
He kissed me.</p>

<p>On the way back to the ship
we saw two skeletons. Each had
its fingers tightly locked about
the other's throat.</p>

<hr />

<p><i>February 20</i></p>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">We</span> have, to date, analyzed
nine hundred types of plant
life for toxin content. Bishop has
tested innumerable spores and
bacteria. Our slide file is immense
and still growing. Max has
captured several insects. There
is one tiny yellow bush-spider
with a killing bite, but the species
seem to be rare. Bishop has isolated
a mold bacterium that
could cause a high fever, but its
propagation rate is far too low
to enable it to last long in the
bloodstream.</p>

<p>The most dangerous animal
seems to be a two-foot-tall arthropod.
They're rare and peaceable.
Bishop vivisected one yesterday
and found nothing alarming.</p>

<p>Last night I dreamed about the
first expedition. I dreamed they
all committed suicide because
Epsilon was too good for them.</p>

<p>This is ridiculous!</p>

<p>We're working in a sort of
quiet madness getting no closer
to the solution.</p>

<p>Armitage talked to Senator
Farragut yesterday and hinted
darkly that the first ship's hydroponics
system went haywire and
that an improper carbohydrate
imbalance killed the colony.
Pretty thin. Farragut's getting
impatient. Bishop looks haggard.
Max looks grim.</p>

<hr />

<p><i>February 23</i></p>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Our</span> quantitative tests are
slowing down. We play a
rubber of bridge each night before
retiring. Last night I trumped
Max's ace and he snarled at
me. We had a fight. This morning
I found a bouquet of purple
spore-thistles at my cabin door.
Max is sweet.</p>

<p>This afternoon, by mutual consent,
we all knocked off work and
played bridge. Bishop noticed the
thistle bouquet in a vase over the
chronometer. He objected.</p>

<p>"They're harmless," Max said.
"Besides, they smell nice."</p>

<p>I can hardly wait for tomorrow's
rubber. Our work is important,
but one does need relaxation.</p>

<hr />

<p><i>February 25</i></p>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Armitage</span> is cheating.</p>

<p>Yesterday he failed to score
one of my overtricks. We argued
bitterly about it. Taylor, of
course, sided with him. Three
hands later, Armitage got the bid
in hearts. "One hundred and fifty
honors," he announced.</p>

<p>"That's a lie," I said.</p>

<p>"It was only a hundred," he
grinned. "But thank you, Greta.
Now I shan't try the queen finesse."</p>

<p>No wonder they've won the
last three evenings! Max is furious
with them both.</p>

<hr />

<p><i>February 28</i></p>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">We</span> played all day. Max and I
kept losing. I always knew
Armitage was a pompous toad,
but I never realized he was <i>slimy</i>.</p>

<p>This afternoon it was game all,
and Armitage overcalled my
diamond opener with three
spades. Bishop took him to four
and I doubled, counting on my
ace-king of hearts and diamonds.</p>

<p>I led out my diamond ace and
Armitage trumped from his
hand. Bishop laid down his dummy.
He had clubs and spades
solid, with doubleton heart and
diamonds.</p>

<p>"None?" Max asked Armitage
dangerously.</p>

<p>Armitage tittered. I wanted to
scratch his eyes out. He drew
trump immediately and set up
clubs on board, dumping the
heart losers from his hand, and
finally sluffing&mdash;<i>two diamonds</i>.</p>

<p>"Made seven," he said complacently,
"less two for the diamond
renege makes five, one
overtrick doubled. We were vulnerable,
so it's game and rubber."</p>

<p>I gasped. "You reneged deliberately!"</p>

<p>"Certainly. Doubleton in
hearts and diamonds in my hand.
If you get in, I'm down one. As
it was, I made an overtrick. The
only penalty for a renege is two
tricks. The rule book does not
differentiate between deliberate
and accidental reneges. Sorry."</p>

<p>I stared at his florid throat, at
his jugular. I could feel my
mouth twitching.</p>

<p>On the next hand I was dummy.
I excused myself and went
into the lab. I found a scalpel. I
came up quietly behind Armitage
and Bishop saw what I was going
to do and shouted and I was not
nearly fast enough. Armitage
ducked and Bishop tackled me.</p>

<p>"Thanks, dear," Max said
thoughtfully, looking at the cards
scattered on the floor. "We would
have been set one trick. Club finesse
fails."</p>

<p>"She's crazy!" Armitage's
mouth worked. "The strain's too
much for her!"</p>

<p>I cried. I apologized hysterically.
After a while, I convinced
them I was all right. Max gave
me a sedative. We did not play
any more bridge. Over supper I
kept staring at Armitage's throat.</p>

<p>After eating, I went for a long
walk. When I got back to the
ship, everyone was sleeping.</p>

<hr />

<p><i>March 1</i></p>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Bishop</span> found Armitage this
morning, in his cabin. He
came out, very pale, staring at
me.</p>

<p>"You bitch," he said. "Ear to
ear. Now what'll I do for a partner?"</p>

<p>"You can't prove it," I said.</p>

<p>"We'll have to confine her to
quarters," Max said wearily. "I'll
tell Farragut."</p>

<p>"And let him know the expedition
is failing?"</p>

<p>Max sighed. "You're right.
We'll tell them Armitage had an
accident."</p>

<p>I said seriously, "It was obviously
suicide. His mind snapped."</p>

<p>"Oh, God," Max said.</p>

<p>They buried Armitage this
afternoon. From my cabin, I
watched them dig the grave.</p>

<p>Cheaters never prosper.</p>

<hr />

<p><i>March 2</i></p>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Max</span> talked with Senator Farragut
this morning. He said
Armitage had died a hero's death.
Farragut sounds worried. The
Pan-Asians have withdrawn their
embassy from Imperial Africa.
Tension is mounting on the home
front. Immigration <i>must</i> start
this week. Max was very reassuring.
"Just a few final tests,
Senator. We want to make sure."</p>

<p>We puttered in our laboratories
all afternoon. Bishop seemed
bored. After dinner he suggested
three-handed bridge and Max
said he knew a better game, a
friendly game his grandmother
had taught him&mdash;hearts.</p>

<hr />

<p><i>March 5</i></p>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">It's</span> a plot!</p>

<p>All day long Bishop and Max
have managed to give me the
queen of spades. It's deliberate,
of course. Three times I've tried
for the moon and Bishop has held
out one damned little heart at
the end. Once Max was slightly
ahead on points and Bishop demanded
to see the score. I
thought for a moment they would
come to blows, but Bishop apologized.</p>

<p>"It's just that I hate to lose,"
he said.</p>

<p>"Quite," Max said.</p>

<p>When we finally turned in,
Bishop was ahead on points.</p>

<p>Too far ahead.</p>

<hr />

<p><i>March 6</i></p>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">I&nbsp;suppose</span> it's Bishop's laugh.
It has a peculiar horselike
stridency that makes me want to
tear out his throat. Twice today
I've broken down and cried when
he made a jackpot.</p>

<p>I'm not going to cry any more.</p>

<p>Supper was the usual, beef-yeast
and vita-ale. I remember
setting Bishop's plate in front of
him, and the way his pale eyes
gleamed between mouthfuls.
"Three thousand points ahead,"
he gloated. "You'll never catch
me now. Never, never!"</p>

<p>That was when he gripped his
throat and began writhing on the
floor.</p>

<p>Max felt his pulse. He stared at
me.</p>

<p>"Very nice," he said. "Quick.
Did you use a derivative of that
green fungus?"</p>

<p>I said nothing. Max's nostrils
were white and pinched. "Must I
make an autopsy?"</p>

<p>"Why bother?" I said. "It's
obviously heart failure."</p>

<p>"Yes, why bother?" he said.
He looked tired. "Stay in your
cabin, Greta. I'll bring your
meals."</p>

<p>"I don't trust you."</p>

<p>His laughter had a touch of
madness.</p>

<hr />

<p><i>March 10</i></p>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Max</span> unlocked my cabin door
this morning. He looked
drawn. "Listen," he said. "I've
checked my respiration, pulse,
saliva, temperature. All normal."</p>

<p>"So?"</p>

<p>"Come here," he said. I followed
him into the lab. He indicated
a microscope. His eyes were
bright.</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"A drop of my blood," he said.
"Look."</p>

<p>I squinted into the microscope.
I saw purple discs. Oddly, they
did not attack the red blood cells.
There was no fission, no mitosis.
The leucocytes, strangely enough,
let them alone.</p>

<p>My hands were shaking as I
took a sterile slide and pricked
my finger. I put the slide under
the microscope. I adjusted the
lens and stared.</p>

<p>Purple discs, swimming in my
bloodstream. Thriving. Minding
their own business.</p>

<p>"Me, too," I said.</p>

<p>"They're inert," Max said
hoarsely. "They don't affect metabolism,
cause fever, or interfere
with the body chemistry in
any way. Do they remind you of
anything?"</p>

<p>I thought about it. Then I went
to the slide file that was marked
<i>flora&mdash;negative</i>.</p>

<p>"Right," Max said. "The purple
thistle. Spores! The atmosphere
is clogged with them.
Greta, my sweet, we're infected."</p>

<p>"I feel fine," I said.</p>

<p>All day long we ran tests. Negative
tests. We seem to be disgustingly
healthy. "Symbiosis,"
Max said finally. "Live and let
live. Apparently we're hosts."</p>

<p>Only one thing disturbs me.</p>

<p>Most symbiotes <i>do</i> something
for their host. Something to enhance
the host's survival potential.</p>

<p>We played chess this evening.
I won. Max is furious. He's such
a poor sport.</p>

<hr />

<p><i>March 11</i></p>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Max</span> talked with Senator Farragut
this morning. He gave
Epsilon a clean bill of health and
the Senator thanked God. "The
first starship will leave tonight,"
the Senator said. "Right on
schedule, with ten thousand colonists
aboard. You're world heroes!"</p>

<p>Max and I played chess the
rest of the day. Max won consistently.
He utilizes a fianchetto
that is utterly impregnable. If he
wins tomorrow, I shall have to
kill him.</p>

<hr />

<h3>MAX</h3>

<p><i>March 13</i></p>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">It</span> was, of course, necessary for
me to destroy Armitage and
Bishop. They won far too often.
But I am sorry about Greta. Yet
I had to strangle her.</p>

<p>If she hadn't started that infernal
queen's pawn opening it
would have been different. She
beat me six times running, and
on the last game I pulled a superb
orang-outang, but it was too
late. She saw mate in four and
gave me that serpent smirk I
know so well.</p>

<p>How could I have ever been in
love with her?</p>

<hr />

<p><i>March 14</i></p>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Frightfully</span> boring to be
alone. I have a thought.
Chess. Right hand against left.
White and black. Jolly good.</p>

<hr />

<p><i>March 16</i></p>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">I&nbsp;haven't</span> much time.</p>

<p>Left was black this morning
and I beat him, four out of five.
We're in the lab now. He's watching
me scribble this. His thumb
and forefinger are twitching in
fury. He looks like some great
white spider about to spring.</p>

<p>He sees the scalpel, by the microscope.
Now his fingers are
inching toward it. Treacherous
beast. I'm stronger. If he tries
to amputate ...</p>
